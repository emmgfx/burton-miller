## Portfolio plugin dependencies:

This theme was made in parallel of the [emm-portfolio](https://github.com/emmgfx/emm-portfolio) plugin, distributed under the same license. It enables the portfolio features in the front-end and the back-end.

This plugin isn't yet distributed in the wordpress directory, so, you should download it from Github and upload to the `wp-content/plugins/`` folder.

## Contact Form 7 integration:

Best results with forms like this:

    [text* your-name placeholder "Your name"]
    [email* your-email placeholder "Your email"]
    [text your-subject placeholder "Subject"]
    [textarea your-message placeholder "Message"]
    [submit "Send" class "btn-burton btn-success"]

 - Use the placheolder param instead of labels.
 - Add the btn-burton and btn-success class to the submit button.
